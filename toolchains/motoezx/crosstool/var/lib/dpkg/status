Package: fakeroot
MkEzx-Sync: 1
Description: Gives a fake root environment
 This package is intended to enable something like:
 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
 i.e. to remove the need to become root for a package build.
 This is done by setting LD_PRELOAD to libfakeroot.so,
 which provides wrappers around getuid, chown, chmod, mknod,
 stat, and so on, thereby creating a fake root environment.
 .
 fakeroot requires SYSV IPC or TCP to operate.

Package: m4
MkEzx-Sync: 1
Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

Package: autoconf
Depends: m4
MkEzx-Sync: 1
Description: automatic configure script builder
 The standard for FSF source packages.  This is only useful if you
 write your own programs or if you extensively modify other people's
 programs.
 .
 For an extensive library of additional Autoconf macros, install the
 `autoconf-archive' package.  For a book that explains how to use
 Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool in conjunction, install the
 `autobook' package.
 .
 The Debian project regards the full documentation for autoconf to be
 non-free, so it is not included in Debian.  Nevertheless, the
 non-free distribution that accompanies Debian includes the manual in
 its `autoconf-doc' package.
 .
 This version of autoconf is not compatible with scripts meant for
 Autoconf 2.13 or earlier.  If you need support for such scripts,
 you must also install the autoconf2.13 package.

Package: automake
Depends: autoconf
MkEzx-Sync: 1
Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.10 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 did, so has been renamed so that the
 previous version can continue to be made available.

Package: libtool
MkEzx-Sync: 1
Description: Generic library support script
 This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
 the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared
 libraries) behind a consistent interface.  To use libtool, add the
 new generic library building commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in,
 or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for details.  Libtool supports
 building static libraries on all platforms.
 .
 Libtool supports generation of C, C++, Fortran and Java libraries.

Package: pkg-config
MkEzx-Sync: 1
Description: manage compile and link flags for libraries
 pkg-config is a system for managing library compile and link flags that
 works with automake and autoconf.
 .
 Increasingly libraries ship with ".pc" files that allow querying of the
 compiler and linker flags needed to use them through the pkg-config(1)
 program.

Package: gettext

Description: GNU Internationalization utilities
 Interesting for authors or maintainers of other packages or programs
 which they want to see internationalized.

Package: file-static
Description: Determines file type using "magic" numbers (static version)
 File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three
 sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic number
 tests, and language tests.  The first test that succeeds causes the
 file type to be printed.
 .
 Starting with version 4, the file command is not much more than a wrapper
 around the "magic" library.
